# Anthology
I'm an avid music listener from the United States of America. I bring music with me everywhere I go. Over time I've lost cassette tapes, CDs, and music libraries from digital services like Napster and Grooveshark at this point. 

I've created this open source music anthology to catalog any music I have found and don't want to lose. Music is cataloged by any available information including artist, album, and song. Genre is something I am trying to figure out how to manage with this, so might be included later. For now, check out the artists, albums, and songs I have found that make music to my ears.

[Pull Requests](https://github.com/sk33lz/anthology/pulls) are welcome for new music suggestions. I love new music!
